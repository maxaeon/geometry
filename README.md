### Interactive Geometry Page README

#### Project Overview:

This interactive geometry webpage is designed for users ranging from kindergarten through graduate school. It offers engaging, interactive activities that guide learners through the construction and exploration of geometric shapes and principles based on Euclidean geometry.

#### Current Status:

* The site is actively under development. Many features and activities are still in progress.

#### Key Features:

* **Interactive Canvas:** Allows dynamic shape creation, manipulation, and exploration.
* **Step-by-Step Activities:** Each activity is designed to provide detailed, interactive, and immediate feedback for learners.

#### Activities (Status):

* **Equilateral Triangles:** Fully implemented interactive tutorial.
* **Other Euclidean Activities:** Currently being developed and expanded.

  * Shape Identification
  * Compose Shapes
  * Shape Attributes
  * Fractions with Shapes
  * Proving Triangle Congruency
  * Circle Theorems
  * Pythagorean Theorem (interactive proof)
  * Parallel Line Theorems
  * Euclid's Five Postulates (advanced explanations under the brain icon)

#### Upcoming Goals:

* Expand step-by-step interactive tutorials for all listed Euclidean activities.
* Enhance user interface for improved visual appeal and intuitive interaction.
* Further align activities clearly with educational standards from California and Michigan.

#### Technical Information:

* Utilizes JavaScript libraries such as p5.js or Paper.js for responsive and dynamic geometry interactions.
* Continuous improvements in user experience, including visual feedback and interaction clarity.

#### Feedback and Contributions:

* Feedback is welcome to help refine and enhance the project.
* Future contributions may include additional interactive features, instructional refinements, and educational resources aligned with school standards.
