# Geometry

This project contains an interactive geometry playground.

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser to choose between a **For Younger Kids** mode with guided activities and an **For Older/Advanced Users** mode with ready-made geometric constructions.

* Younger kids can step through several activities using the **Back** and **Next** buttons. Prompts guide them to connect dots, experiment with dotted and solid lines, identify right angles, and even construct an equilateral triangle step by step.
* Advanced users may draw freely and load examples such as equilateral triangles, triangle congruency, circle theorems, the Pythagorean theorem and parallel line theorems.

Shapes can be dragged, resized and combined. Intersections are highlighted automatically for visual feedback.
Use the **Fill** tool to color enclosed regions and toggle the **Grid** checkbox for a graph-paper background.
The toolbar now provides icon-style buttons for common tools, similar to classic paint programs.
