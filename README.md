# Geometry

This project contains an interactive geometry playground.

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser and click **Start** to launch the drawing interface.

Select the page icon to open the activities overlay and browse step-by-step tutorials.
Pick a tutorial from the overlay or use the **Activities** dropdown in the toolbar to switch tasks at any time.

Shapes can be dragged, resized and combined. Intersections are highlighted automatically for visual feedback.
Use the **Fill** tool, now shown as a bucket icon, to color enclosed regions. The grid is displayed by default; toggle the **Grid** checkbox to hide or show it.
The toolbar now provides icon-style buttons for common tools, similar to classic paint programs. A color palette lets you quickly pick or add colors, and a **Delete Shape** button removes the currently selected shape.
There is also a cross-hatched swatch for choosing **transparent** fill. Bucket fill with this option clears pixels instead of painting them.

Click the new **brain icon** in the toolbar to see additional context about the current activity. The pop-up shows formulas like area or circumference and you can reveal a short explanation of why they work.

Use the **book icon** to open the dictionary and flashcard set. This icon is available on the start screen and in the drawing toolbar so you can quickly review terms at any time.
