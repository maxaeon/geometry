# Geometry

This project contains an interactive geometry playground.

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser to choose between a **For Younger Kids** mode with guided activities and an **For Older/Advanced Users** mode with ready-made geometric constructions.

* Younger kids can step through several activities using the **Back** and **Next** buttons. Prompts guide them to connect dots, experiment with dotted and solid lines, identify right angles, and even construct an equilateral triangle step by step.
* Advanced users may draw freely and load examples such as equilateral triangles, triangle congruency, circle theorems, the Pythagorean theorem and parallel line theorems.

Shapes can be dragged, resized and combined. Intersections are highlighted automatically for visual feedback.
Use the **Fill** tool to color enclosed regions. The grid is displayed by default; toggle the **Grid** checkbox to hide or show it.
The toolbar now provides icon-style buttons for common tools, similar to classic paint programs. A color palette lets you quickly pick or add colors, and a **Delete Shape** button removes the currently selected shape.
There is also a cross-hatched swatch for choosing **transparent** fill. Bucket fill with this option clears pixels instead of painting them.

Click the new **brain icon** in the toolbar to see additional context about the current activity. The pop-up shows formulas like area or circumference and you can reveal a short explanation of why they work.
